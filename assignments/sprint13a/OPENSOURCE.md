I think its beneficial to participate in open source becuase its an easy way to get practice with many different technologies, see how teams work together, and you can easily expand your network if you join a community and actively work on their open source project. also, there is most likely something already made that you wanted to incorporate into your own project, so you don't have to start from scratch.
