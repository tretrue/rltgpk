# Reflection
### I had no real difficulties when following the video. Everything was pretty clear. 

### I hope to have a functional SSO, that actually saves and secures users. I think the idea of getting rid of cookies and replacing it with SSO is actually a great idea. I see it, based from what i read, as a great alternative that offers more security for daily users. It does seem a bit tougher then programming your average cookie, but nonetheless pays off in the long run.
