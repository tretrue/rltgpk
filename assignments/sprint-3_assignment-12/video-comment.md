# Evolution Meeting

After viewing the video of the Evolution meeting, i love how thourough the evalutation of each Pull Request (PR) is. It seems slightly tedious, but I can see that this way of evaluating each PR is very beneficial. This way everyone is collaborating on each PR, so everything is transparent of what exactly the PR does, and the issue the PR is made to resolve won't have to be revisited.

I am drafting a metric for this working group, and hope that my metric will make a great fit.
